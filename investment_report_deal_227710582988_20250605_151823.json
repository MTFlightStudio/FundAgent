It\u2019s personalised, preventative, and based on the science of why behaviour happens in the first place, something most systems completely ignore.\r\n\r\nOur innovation isn\u2019t just in the tech, it\u2019s in the model. We\u2019re giving frontline carers access to the kind of behavioural insight that\u2019s usually locked away in specialist services, and doing it in a way that\u2019s fast, affordable, easy to use on the job, and a globally scalable solution.",
          "how_does_your_product_contribute_to_a_healthier__happier_whole_human_experience_": "Less Distress is about making things better for everyone involved in dementia care: The person, the carer, and the family.\r\n\r\nAll behaviour happens for a reason. In dementia, that reason is often an unmet need, but it\u2019s very hard for carers to understand what the need is without proper training (which they very rarely receive). We help carers see what the behaviour is trying to say, so they can respond in a way that meets the need, not just manages the reaction.\r\n\r\nWhen carers can predict distress before it happens, they can step in early and calmly, rather than reacting in crisis. Right now, when distressed behaviour is difficult for carers to support with, people are given unlicensed antipsychotics just to keep them sedated even though the side effects can be devastating: sedation, stroke, and death. It\u2019s not person-centred care, it\u2019s damage control.\r\n\r\nLess Distress helps change that. We give carers real tools, grounded in behavioural science, so they can reduce medication, prevent placement breakdowns, and support the person effectively. That means more dignity, more calm, and more moments where people feel understood, not lost.\r\n\r\nWhen it feels like no one cares...emwillcare",
