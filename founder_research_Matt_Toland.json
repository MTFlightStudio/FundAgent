The results indicate there is a Matt Toland who is a senior data scientist at a company called FLIGHTSTORY, as well as a Matt Toland who works in business development at an architecture firm called Toland & Mizell Architects. However, I did not find clear evidence that either of these individuals is a founder of a company. The search results also mention a Matt Toland who is an anesthesiologist, but he appears to be a different person. Without a LinkedIn profile or other reliable source of information, I do not have enough details to confidently summarize the background and expertise of a founder named Matt Toland.",
