He holds a First Class Master's degree in Aeronautics with Spacecraft Engineering from Imperial College London, where he was on the Dean's List, and gained early leadership experience as a Propulsion Engineering Team Lead for the university's rocketry group. His credibility is further bolstered by experience at notable tech companies like Darktrace and MathWorks, and most significantly, his current venture, Astron Systems, is a graduate of the Techstars Space 2024 accelerator. Eddie's content on LinkedIn establishes him as a founder with a clear, deeply-held, and contrarian vision for the space industry. His posts are direct, opinionated, and focused on a singular mission: proving that 100% rocket reusability is the only viable future for commercial space launch. He actively debunks what he considers industry misconceptions and advocates for higher standards in sustainability and technology. While his audience is niche, his voice is that of a subject matter expert with a strong founder-led point of view, signaling significant brand potential as a leader in the European space-tech ecosystem.","previous_companies":[{"company_name":"Astron Systems Ltd.","role":"CEO, Co-Founder, Aerospace Engineer","duration":"4 yrs 3 mos","description":"Leading a space technology company focused on 100% rocket reusability.
