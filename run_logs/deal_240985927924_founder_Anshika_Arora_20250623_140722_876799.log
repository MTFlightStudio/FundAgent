With a background in Business Management and a brief stint at HSBC, her primary focus for the last three years has been building this venture, which was born from a clear, personal pain point she observed. She has simultaneously built deep domain expertise as a freelance consultant, advising wedding venues on reaching Multicultural and Gen-Z audiences. Anshika demonstrates significant credibility and influence within her niche. Her recent appointment to the UK Wedding Association's Advisory Board as a \"Gen-Z, Fusion & Emerging Trends Advisor\" is a strong signal of industry recognition.

Her voice is that of a confident, founder-led expert who is actively building a community through podcasting and industry networking, indicating strong personal brand potential and audience resonance.","previous_companies":[{"company_name":"HSBC","role":null,"duration":null,"description":"Brief stint at HSBC prior to founding Eternity.","was_founder":false},{"company_name":"Freelance Consultant (Wedding Industry)","role":"Consultant","duration":null,"description":"Advised wedding venues on reaching Multicultural and Gen-Z audiences.","was_founder":false}],"education":[{"institution":null,"degree":"Business Management","field_of_study":null,"graduation_year":null,"notable_achievements":null}],"key_skills_and_expertise":null,"public_speaking_or_content":null,"investment_criteria_assessment":{"focus_industry_fit":true,"mission_alignment":true,"exciting_solution_to_problem":true,"founded_something_relevant_before":false,"impressive_relevant_past_experience":false,"exceptionally_smart_or_strategic":true,"assessment_summary":"Anshika Arora is a first-time founder with strong domain expertise in the wedding industry, recognized for her thought leadership and advisory role.
