Not recommended for children or pregnant or breast-feeding women'). Most major UK retailers voluntarily restrict sales of energy drinks to those over 16. The Soft Drinks Industry Levy (sugar tax) applies to drinks with high sugar content, incentivizing reformulation. No matcha-specific regulations, but general food safety, labeling, and caffeine limits apply."
