- Export functionality (now working properly with unique button keys)
- Type mismatches between agents and UI (resolved with Pydantic model_dump)
- Missing AgentRunner implementation (completed and tested)

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Speed Up Agent Execution

The agents take 1-3 minutes each because they're making multiple API calls. Here are ways to improve performance:

#### Add Progress Indicators

In `ai_agents/ui/agent_runner.py`, add real-time progress updates:

**Cursor Prompt:**

```
Update the run_company_research, run_founder_research, and run_market_research methods in ai_agents/ui/agent_runner.py to:
1. Use st.progress() to show progress bars with percentage completion
2. Use st.status() to show current operation (e.g., "Searching web for company info...")
3. Add time estimates based on typical execution times (Company: ~2 min, Founder: ~1.5 min, Market: ~2.5 min)
4. Show intermediate results as they become available
5. Update workflow visualization in real-time as each step completes
```

#### Enable Caching

**Cursor Prompt:**

```
Add intelligent caching to ai_agents/ui/agent_runner.py:
1. Use @st.cache_data decorator on agent research methods
2. Cache by company name, founder name, and industry sector
3. Add cache expiration after 24 hours
4. Add a "Clear Cache" button in the sidebar
5. Show cache hit/miss status in the UI with timestamps
6. Store cache in organized directory structure (cache/company/, cache/founder/, cache/market/)
```

### 2. Improve User Experience

#### Add Loading Animations

**Cursor Prompt:**

```
In streamlit_app.py, add better loading feedback:
1. Use st.spinner() with custom messages for each agent ("üîç Researching company profile...", "üë§ Analyzing founder background...", etc.)
2. Add animated progress bars that update in real-time
3. Show estimated time remaining based on historical execution times
4. Display partial results as they stream in (show company basic info while detailed analysis continues)
5. Add a "Cancel" button for long-running operations
```

#### Add Quick Actions

**Cursor Prompt:**

```
Add quick action buttons to streamlit_app.py sidebar:
1. "Load Sample Data" - pre-fill with emwillcare (deal 227710582988) for demos
2. "Clear All Results" - reset the session state completely
3. "Export to PDF" - generate a formatted investment report with company logo and charts
4. "Share Results" - create a shareable link or email summary
5. "Compare Multiple Companies" - side-by-side analysis view
6. "Schedule Report" - set up automated analysis runs
```

### 3. Error Handling Improvements

#### Better Error Messages

**Cursor Prompt:**

```
Update error handling in ai_agents/ui/agent_runner.py:
1. Catch specific error types (API rate limits, network timeouts, invalid data, etc.)
2. Provide actionable error messages with next steps
3. Add "Retry" buttons for failed operations with exponential backoff
4. Log errors to ai_agents/logs/debug.log with timestamps
5. Show which data is still usable despite partial failures
6. Add fallback data sources when primary APIs fail
7. Validate HubSpot deal IDs before processing
```

### 4. Data Visualization Enhancements

#### Add Interactive Charts

**Cursor Prompt:**

```
Create a new file ai_agents/ui/visualizations.py with interactive charts:
1. Investment criteria spider/radar chart using Plotly (6 Flight Story criteria as axes)
2. Funding history timeline with interactive hover details
3. Market size comparison charts (TAM, SAM, SOM breakdown)
4. Founder assessment comparison grid with skills matrix
5. Risk vs. opportunity matrix with quadrant analysis
6. Competitive landscape positioning chart
7. Financial projections visualization
8. Export charts as PNG/SVG for presentations
```

### 5. Advanced Features

#### Batch Processing

**Cursor Prompt:**

```
Add batch processing capability to streamlit_app.py:
1. Allow CSV upload with multiple deals/companies (columns: deal_id, company_name, founder_name, industry)
2. Process multiple companies in parallel with progress tracking
3. Generate comparison reports across all analyzed companies
4. Export batch results to Excel with multiple sheets
5. Show summary dashboard with pass/fail rates and key metrics
6. Add filtering and sorting capabilities for batch results
```

#### Real-time Collaboration

**Cursor Prompt:**

```
Add collaboration features to streamlit_app.py:
1. Save analysis sessions with unique IDs in sessions/ directory
2. Allow sharing via URL with session token
3. Add comments on specific findings with user attribution
4. Track changes over time with version history
5. Compare multiple analyses side-by-side
6. Add user authentication and role-based access
7. Export shareable presentation slides
```

## Quick Fixes to Implement Now

### 1. Add Session Persistence

```python
# Add to streamlit_app.py in the sidebar:
import json
from datetime import datetime
import os

if not os.path.exists("sessions"):
    os.makedirs("sessions")

if st.button("üíæ Save Session", key="save_session"):
    session_id = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
    session_data = {
        "results": st.session_state.get('results', {}),
        "workflow_state": st.session_state.get('workflow_state', {}),
        "input_method": st.session_state.get('input_method', 'hubspot'),
        "deal_id": st.session_state.get('deal_id', ''),
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "summary": {
            "company": st.session_state.results.get('company_research', {}).get('company_name', 'Unknown'),
            "recommendation": st.session_state.results.get('decision_support', {}).get('recommendation', 'Unknown'),
            "confidence": st.session_state.results.get('decision_support', {}).get('confidence_score', 0)
        }
    }
    with open(f"sessions/session_{session_id}.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(session_data, f, indent=2)
    st.success(f"üíæ Session saved: session_{session_id}")

# Add session loader
saved_sessions = [f for f in os.listdir("sessions") if f.endswith('.json')] if os.path.exists("sessions") else []
if saved_sessions:
    selected_session = st.selectbox("üìÇ Load Saved Session:", [""] + saved_sessions, key="load_session")
    if selected_session and st.button("üìÇ Load", key="load_session_btn"):
        with open(f"sessions/{selected_session}", "r") as f:
            session_data = json.load(f)
        for key, value in session_data.items():
            if key != "timestamp":
                st.session_state[key] = value
        st.success(f"üìÇ Loaded session: {selected_session}")
        st.rerun()
```

### 2. Add Execution Time Tracking

```python
# Add to ai_agents/ui/agent_runner.py in each run method:
import time

# At start of each agent method:
start_time = time.time()
st.session_state.setdefault('execution_times', {})

# At end of each agent method:
execution_time = time.time() - start_time
st.session_state.execution_times[f'{agent_name}'] = execution_time
st.info(f"‚è±Ô∏è {agent_name} completed in {execution_time:.1f} seconds")
```

### 3. Add System Health Check

```python
# Add to streamlit_app.py sidebar:
with st.expander("üîç System Status"):
    col1, col2 = st.columns(2)

    with col1:
        st.metric("üîó HubSpot", "Connected" if check_hubspot_connection() else "Error")
        st.metric("ü§ñ OpenAI", "Active" if check_openai_connection() else "Error")
        st.metric("üîç Tavily", "Active" if check_tavily_connection() else "Error")

    with col2:
        st.metric("üíæ Cache Size", f"{get_cache_size()} MB")
        st.metric("üìä Sessions", len(saved_sessions) if 'saved_sessions' in locals() else 0)
        if 'execution_times' in st.session_state:
            avg_time = sum(st.session_state.execution_times.values()) / len(st.session_state.execution_times)
            st.metric("‚è±Ô∏è Avg Runtime", f"{avg_time:.1f}s")
```
