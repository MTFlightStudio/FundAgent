      "background_summary": "Tom Standen is the founder of Sylvi, a tech startup he has been building for over a year and a half. His background is academically strong, with a Master's in Physics from The University of Manchester and UCLA. Prior to founding Sylvi, he built a formidable corporate career in strategy and analytics, working at both IBM and, most recently, McKinsey & Company. This experience at elite consulting firms signals a high level of strategic and analytical capability. His recent content on LinkedIn is focused on building Sylvi in public, demonstrating significant momentum and founder-led credibility. Key posts highlight a recently closed \u00a3350k angel round from notable investors, a new key hire, and product development driven directly by community feedback. His tone is confident and modern, using creative formats (e.g., a football-style \"transfer announcement\" for a new hire) that suggest strong brand-building potential. The posts consistently generate good engagement, indicating a supportive and interested network. His focus on running design workshops with students suggests Sylvi may operate in the EdTech space.",
