Right now, too many of them are losing out to tech giants, voucher plugins, and cashback sites that hijack their efforts. We\u2019re flipping that model by making sure the people who actually drive the sale get rewarded. It\u2019s about levelling the playing field and helping creators build real businesses on their own terms.",

    "please_expand": "We\u2019re currently focused on two key areas:\r\n\r\n1) Raising funding to scale the business, and\r\n\r\n2) Strategic support to expand our reach within the creator economy.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve gained strong traction with all major UK publishers and have purposely held off on monetising while we refined product-market fit, though commercial terms are signed and ready to activate.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re now rolling out our Transactable Storefronts product, including a major partnership with YMU and their roster of high-profile creators.\r\n\r\nWe believe FlightFund has a strong understanding of this space and would be a natural strategic fit, helping accelerate growth and open doors across the creator economy.",
