    "description": "We're a language learning app that's fundamentally different - using AI to help people actually speak a language, not just learn grammar rules and vocab. Through conversations with AI tutors and penpals, discussing news in your target language, and practicing with fellow learners / friends, you get instant corrections and feedback on every interaction.",

    "business_model": "Sylvi is different as it combines social learning with AI in ways competitors haven't achieved.

However, anxiety about making mistakes often prevents people from speaking, which is crucial for development. Sylvi transforms language learning into a confident, social experience through daily conversations with instant, private corrections - all at a fraction of the cost of private tutoring, making it more accessible.",
